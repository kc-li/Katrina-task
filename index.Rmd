```{r}
download.file(url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cambiotraining/reproducibility-training/master/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile="data/gapminder_data.csv")
```

```{r intro-chunk, message=FALSE}
#load tidyverse library
library(tidyverse) # used for data manipulation
library(rmarkdown) # used for paged_table function
library(kableExtra) # used for table

#read file into R
pop_data <- read_csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")

#create a table with data from European countries in 2007 showing the countries with the largest life expectancy at the top 
euro_data_tbl <- pop_data %>% 
                    filter(continent == "Europe" & year == 2007) %>% 
                    select(-continent, -year) %>% 
                    arrange(desc(lifeExp)) %>% 
                    rename(Country = country, "Population Size" = pop, "Life Expectancy" = lifeExp, "GDP" = gdpPercap)
                    
```

The results in euro_data_tbl are displayed in the Table below:

```{r kable-chunk, echo=FALSE}
euro_data_tbl %>% 
          kable(caption="European countries ordered by greatest life expectancy from 2007 data") %>% 
          kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F) %>% 
          scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "200px")
```

A better way to display this table is with pagination as follows:

```{r paged-table-chunk, echo=FALSE}
paged_table(euro_data_tbl)
```

Next, the life expectancy in Europe is observed across different years.  The aim of this is to check if there was a change in life expectancy over the years.  The data used for the life expectancy over the years analysis is the gapminder data and the following data manipulation was performed:

```{r fig-data-chunk}
#keep on European data and change year to factor
euro_data_fig <- pop_data %>% 
                    filter(continent == "Europe")  %>% 
                    mutate(year=as_factor(year))
```

The life expactancy over the years is plotted as following:

```{r fig-chunk, fig.cap="Life Expectancy in Europe over the years"}
euro_data_fig %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) +
    geom_violin() +
    stat_summary(fun.y = median, geom = "point")
```
